# power9 — an Omarchy theme

IBM Blue 60 (`#0f62fe`) and POWER9 green (`#9fe870`), split evenly. Blue owns
focus and structure, green owns confirmation and accent.

## Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/themes
cp -r power9 ~/.config/omarchy/themes/
omarchy theme set power9
```

Because you wrote this theme yourself (no `.git` inside it), Omarchy treats it
as unrestricted and keeps every file. Cycle wallpapers with
`omarchy theme bg next`.

## What each file does

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `colors.toml` | The only colour source. Omarchy generates alacritty, btop, hyprland, neovim, kitty, ghostty, foot, helix, chromium, vscode and `shell.toml` from it via `$OMARCHY_PATH/default/themed/*.tpl`. |
| `backgrounds/` | Three 3840×2160 wallpapers: cube mark, flat swirl, ASCII field. |
| `unlock.png` | Lock screen background (omarchy mark version). |
| `preview.png` | Thumbnail in the `omarchy theme` picker. |
| `preview-unlock.png` | Lock-screen preview in the theme switcher. |
| `shell.lock.toml` | Optional override for the lock password field. Delete it to use the generated default. |
| `icons.theme` | GTK icon set. |
| `extras/unlock-openpower.png` | Alternate lock background using the OpenPOWER wordmark. Swap over `unlock.png` if you prefer it. |

Templates only write a file if the theme folder does not already contain one
(`omarchy-theme-set-templates`, line 396). So dropping a hand-written
`btop.theme`, `alacritty.toml` or `hyprland.lua` in here **overrides** the
generated version for this theme, and it will not be clobbered. This theme
ships a static `btop.theme` for exactly that reason — see below.

To change how an app is themed for *every* theme, override the template
instead:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/themed
cp /usr/share/omarchy/default/themed/btop.theme.tpl ~/.config/omarchy/themed/
```

## fastfetch

fastfetch is not part of the theme spec, so it is wired up separately. The
logos are ANSI-coloured raw text, blue→green.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/fastfetch
ln -sf ~/.config/omarchy/themes/power9/fastfetch/config.jsonc \
       ~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc
```

Available logos, all pre-coloured:

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `logo-swirl.txt` | 40 × 20 | Face-on swirl. Default. |
| `logo-cube.txt` | 56 × 30 | Isometric cube, half-blocks. |
| `logo-cube-50.txt` | 50 × 20 | Cube + centered wordmark, half-blocks. Squashed to fit. |
| `logo-cube-braille-50.txt` | 50 × 20 | Cube + wordmark in braille dots. 8× the sample density. |
| `logo-cube-braille-52.txt` | 52 × 30 | Braille at true isometric proportion. Sharpest of the set. |

Braille packs 2 × 4 dots into each cell, so it resolves the spiral far better
than half-blocks at the same width. Two caveats: your font needs U+2800–28FF
coverage (most Nerd Fonts have it), and a few terminals render braille cells
slightly narrow, which shears the cube. Check with `cat` before committing to it.

Quick check without installing:

```bash
fastfetch --logo-type file-raw --logo ~/.config/omarchy/themes/power9/fastfetch/logo-cube.txt
```

Note that `omarchy-launch-about` re-renders its own layout and will defer to
`~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc` once it exists.

## ASCII art (`ascii/`)

Plain text, no theme hooks — install these by hand.

| File | Where it goes |
|---|---|
| `banner.txt` / `banner-ansi.txt` | Shell startup. Add `cat ~/.config/omarchy/themes/power9/ascii/banner-ansi.txt` to `~/.bashrc`. The ANSI one is pre-coloured blue→green; the plain one takes `tput setaf`. |
| `motd` | `sudo cp motd /etc/motd` |
| `issue` | `sudo cp issue /etc/issue` — keeps agetty escapes (`\S` `\r` `\m` `\l` `\n`) literal, so they expand at login. |
| `splash.txt` | Boot splash / initramfs `echo`. Centred for 80 columns. |
| `die.txt` | POWER9 floorplan, 44 cols. Good as a btop header or in the MOTD. |
| `chip-small.txt` | Compact chip, 28 cols. |

Widths are fixed — they assume a monospace font and will wrap below the column
count listed.

## btop

The stock template maps btop's chrome to `magenta`, `red` and `cyan`, which
drags purple and red into the UI. Bending those tokens in `colors.toml` would
fix btop but also recolour neovim's diff markers and error states.

So this theme ships a static `btop.theme` instead. Because the generator skips
any file already in the theme folder, it survives `omarchy theme set` and
affects nothing else.

What it does:

- Box borders blue and green only — cpu/proc `#0f62fe`, mem `#9fe870`, net `#78a9ff`
- CPU, process and used-memory gradients run green → cyan → blue
- Network split by direction: download in blues, upload in greens
- Free/available meters use the neutral ramp so they recede
- **Temperature keeps green → yellow → red.** Hot hardware should look wrong,
  and on an AC922 that matters more than palette purity. Change
  `temp_mid`/`temp_end` if you disagree.

Reload after editing:

```bash
omarchy-restart-btop
```

To apply the same treatment to every theme instead, copy it as a template:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/themed
cp ~/.config/omarchy/themes/power9/btop.theme ~/.config/omarchy/themed/btop.theme.tpl
```

Then swap the literal hexes back to `{{ blue }}`, `{{ green }}`,
`{{ bright_blue }}` and so on, so each theme fills in its own palette.

## Obsidian (`obsidian/`)

**Read this first:** Omarchy 4 already generates Obsidian theming from
`colors.toml`, so you may not need this at all. Run `omarchy theme set power9`
and check Obsidian before installing anything here.

What the generated output gives you is the palette. What this folder adds is
structural CSS the template cannot express — squared corners, the heading
colour ladder, the gradient blockquote rail, bordered inline code. Install it
only if you want those.

It is a standalone Obsidian theme, installed the Obsidian way:

```bash
mkdir -p /path/to/vault/.obsidian/themes/power9
cp obsidian/* /path/to/vault/.obsidian/themes/power9/
```

Then Settings → Appearance → Themes → **power9**. Per-vault, so repeat it for
each vault.

Colours come straight from `colors.toml`. Editorial choices worth knowing:

- Headings step blue → green as they get deeper (h1 white, h2 `#78a9ff`, h3 `#9fe870`)
- Internal links green, external links blue — so you can tell them apart at a glance
- Inline code green, matching how strings read in the terminal
- Corners squared (`--radius-*: 0`) to match the rest of the theme
- Graph view: nodes blue, focused node green
- Syntax keeps magenta for keywords and red for errors — a two-colour code
  view is unreadable

If you would rather layer on top of your current theme than replace it, use it
as a snippet instead:

```bash
cp obsidian/theme.css /path/to/vault/.obsidian/snippets/power9.css
```

Enable under Settings → Appearance → CSS snippets.

## Distributing it

If you push this as a public repo, name it `omarchy-power9-theme` — Omarchy
strips the `omarchy-` prefix and `-theme` suffix, so it appears as **power9**
in the theme menu. Others install it with:

```bash
omarchy theme install https://github.com/<you>/omarchy-power9-theme
```

A cloned theme is filtered at staging: Omarchy drops anything that can execute
code — `*.lua`, `alacritty.toml`, `foot.ini`, `ghostty.conf`, `kitty.conf`,
`vscode.json`, and symlinks at any depth — and regenerates those from its own
templates instead. Dropped files are named on stderr.

This theme ships none of those, so it survives cloning intact. `btop.theme`
is explicitly on the kept list ("everything a cloned theme ships that is
colour is kept"), which is why the hand-written btop override works for other
people and not just for you.

Move `ascii/` and `obsidian/` out before publishing if you want the repo to be
pure theme — neither is part of the spec, and the theme gallery only checks for
`colors.toml` plus a README with a screenshot.

## Hiding the minimize button

Short answer: not from the theme, and no Omarchy theme does it — there is
nothing in the theme spec for window controls.

Where it actually lives depends on the app:

**Hyprland itself** draws no titlebars at all. There is no server-side
minimize button to hide, and Hyprland has no minimize concept — `special`
workspaces are the closest thing.

**GTK apps** (Nautilus, GNOME Text Editor, etc.) draw their own client-side
decorations, and the button set is a GTK setting, not a theme file:

```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout ':close'
```

That leaves only close on the right. `':'` alone removes all of them. To make
it stick across reboots, add it to `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`:

```ini
[Settings]
gtk-decoration-layout=:close
```

and the same key in `~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini`.

**Electron apps** (Obsidian, VS Code, Discord) each have their own setting.
Obsidian: Settings → Appearance → **Native frame** off, which hands the
titlebar to Obsidian's own minimal chrome.

Checked against Omarchy's theming docs: there is no window-control key in the
theme spec at any level. The full list a theme may ship is `colors.toml`,
hand-written config overrides, `backgrounds/`, `preview.png`,
`preview-unlock.png`, `icons.theme`, `keyboard.rgb`, `unlock.png` and a
`light.mode` marker. Window buttons are not in it, so this stays a GTK-level
change regardless of theme.

Hyprland active border is the gradient `rgba(0f62feff) rgba(9fe870ff) 45deg`.

## Trademark note

The wallpapers place the POWER9 badge and an Omarchy-derived cube mark. Both
are third-party marks — fine on your own machine, worth clearing before you
publish the theme anywhere.
